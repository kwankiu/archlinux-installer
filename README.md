![alt archlinux logo](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/73/Archlinux-logo-inverted-version.png/500px-Archlinux-logo-inverted-version.png)

This is an installation script that gets you through an installation of Arch Linux on Rockchip RK3588 SoC.

### Currently only works with Radxa Rock 5B.

# How to install?
Download and run the script below:
 ```bash
bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kwankiu/archlinux-installer-rock5/main/archlinux-installer)
```

This will get you a bootable Arch Linux rootfs on your Disk. The default login is alarm/alarm and root login is root/root.

# Installation

1. To continue the installation, now boot to Arch Linux and login as root/root
2. Run the command
```
arch-rock-installer
```
3. The script will reboot after creating a user account and updating a root password. 

To continue the installation, log back to root/root and re-run the command
```
arch-rock-installer
```
Tips :
If it says that the linux package have a conflict, this is normal, confirm and let the script install the kernel.
If you want a Desktop Environment, pick a Desktop Environment to install.

4. Once it's done, the script should automatically reboot your system. Enjoy!

# Usage

```
archlinux-installer <options/disk_path> <kernel>
```

### Options

| Options | Additional Arguments | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| `-h` or `--help` | N/A | Usage and Infomation of this installer. |
| `-d` or `--dev` | N/A | Use latest dev installation script. |

### Optional arguments
| Argument | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| `<disk_path>` | Specify the installation path, this should be a disk path not a partition path. On the Rock 5B, it is /dev/nvme0n1 for NVMe SSD, /dev/mmcblk0 for uSD Card, and /dev/mmcblk1 for eMMC. For SATA or External disk, they are usually on /dev/sdX, which X is usually starting from a-z. |
| `<kernel>` | Currently available options for kernel are `rkbsp` and `midstream`. You may optionally specifiy a custom kernel by specifying the path to the file. This can be a tar (.tar.gz or .tar.xz) or image (.img). |

## Examples

#### Typical Usage (Same as [How to install?](https://github.com/kwankiu/archlinux-installer-rock5#how-to-install) section)

This command will prompt for picking installation options.

```
bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kwankiu/archlinux-installer-rock5/main/archlinux-installer)
```

#### Using  `<disk_path>`
#### (e.g. /dev/sdb)

This command will let you pick a kernel and install Arch Linux to your disk path.

```
bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kwankiu/archlinux-installer-rock5/main/archlinux-installer) /dev/sdb
```

#### Using both `<disk_path>` and`<kernel>`
#### (e.g. /dev/nvme0n1 for `<disk_path>` and rkbsp for `<kernel>`)

This command will install Arch Linux with Radxa BSP Kernel to your disk path.

```
bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kwankiu/archlinux-installer-rock5/main/archlinux-installer) /dev/nvme0n1 rkbsp
```

#### Using dev branch version
#### (WARNING: dev branch are not tested and may be broken.)

This command will use the script from dev branch and prompt for picking installation options.

```
bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kwankiu/archlinux-installer-rock5/main/archlinux-installer) --dev
```

# Arch Rock Configuration Utility (experimental)
We have created a configuration utility `arch-rock-config` just like [armbian-config](https://github.com/armbian/config), [rsetup](https://docs.radxa.com/en/radxa-os/rsetup/rsetup-tool), or [raspi-config](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/configuration.html) but for Arch Linux running on Rock 5 / RK3588.

You can reinstall/replace the Linux Kernel using `arch-rock-config` :
```
# replace <kernel> with rkbsp, rkbsp-git or midstream

arch-rock-config install-kernel <kernel>
```

# Known Issues / Troubleshooting
1. Functionality to create an .img image is still work-in-progress.
2. Installation Script is known to run on Debian / Ubuntu / Arch Linux / WSL (Experimental)
3. macOS is not supported. You may use Docker or VM and mount your disk to it.

# How to install?
Download and run the script below:
 ```bash
bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kwankiu/archlinux-installer-rock5/main/archlinux-installer)
```

This will get you a bootable Arch Linux rootfs on your Disk. The default login is alarm/alarm and root login is root/root.

# Installation

1. To continue our installation, now boot to Arch Linux and login as root/root
2. Run the command
```
arch-rock-installer
```
3. The script will reboot after creating a user account and updating a root password. To continue the installation, you may need to log back to root/root and re-run the command
```
arch-rock-installer
```
4. If it saids the linux package have a conflict, this is normal, confirm and let the script install the kernel.
5. If you want a Desktop Environment, pick a Desktop Environment to install.
6. Once it's done, the script should automatically reboot your system. Enjoy!

# Usage

## Optional arguments

```
archlinux-installer <disk_path> <kernel>
```

| Argument | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| `<disk_path>` | Specify the installation path, this should be a disk path not a partition path. On the Rock 5B, it is /dev/nvme0n1 for NVMe SSD, /dev/mmcblk0 for uSD Card, and /dev/mmcblk1 for eMMC. For SATA or External disk, they are usually on /dev/sdX, which X is usually starting from a-z. |
| `<kernel>` | Currently available options for kernel are `rkbsp` and `midstream`. You may optionally specifiy a custom kernel by specifying the path to the file. This can be a tar (.tar.gz or .tar.xz) or image (.img). |

## Examples

1. Run without any arguments (Same as the "How to install?" section above)

The script will prompt for picking installation options.

```
bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kwankiu/archlinux-installer-rock5/main/archlinux-installer)
```

2. Passing only the first argument `<disk_path>` (e.g. /dev/sdb)

The script will let you pick a kernel and install Arch Linux to your disk path.

```
bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kwankiu/archlinux-installer-rock5/main/archlinux-installer) /dev/sdb
```

3. Passing both argument `<disk_path>` `<kernel>` (e.g. /dev/nvme0n1 for `<disk_path>` and rkbsp for `<kernel>`)

The script will install Arch Linux with Radxa BSP Kernel to your disk path.

```
bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kwankiu/archlinux-installer-rock5/main/archlinux-installer) /dev/nvme0n1 rkbsp
```

# More Info

## The `arch-rock-config` Configuration Utility (experimental)
We have created a configuration utility just like `armbian-config` or `raspi-config` but for Arch Linux running on Rock 5B / RK3588.
Note that this configuration utility is work-in-progress.

To run this :
```
arch-rock-config
```

arch-rock-config install-kernel
```

## Post Installation 

If you have installed your system with `arch-rock-installer`, it is not required to run post-install again
This Post Installation Tools is work-in-progress.

# WIP / TODO List / Known Issues
1. Functionality to create an .img image is still work-in-progress.
2. When choosing a disk, on some system, the path may not be read properly (/dev/nvme0n1 1024G may become /dev/1024G, temp solution is to manually enter the disk path)

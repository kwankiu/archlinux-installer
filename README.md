# Installation

1. Power ON your Device with the **Storage Device** and **Ethernet Cable (or WiFi Adapter)** plugged in .  
- If your first boot shows a user login screen instead, login to root/root and run `installer`.

2. The installer will run some setups and you should be prompted to create a user account. Follow the instructions and it should automatically reboot and login to the newly created user account.
- If it does not log in automatically, log in to your newly created user account. 
- If the installer does not start automatically, run `installer` to start it.

3. The installer will guide you through the installation of Arch Linux with your desired Settings, Kernel, Desktop Environment, and Software, Enjoy!

More details can be found at our [wiki](https://github.com/kwankiu/archlinux-installer-rock5/wiki/Installation).

# Troubleshooting

1. If you get stuck while rebooting, unplug the power and power it on manually.

2. WiFi support is experimental. This is only tested on RTL8852BE, other WiFi adapter may not work properly, refer to armbian firmware for supported WiFi adapter.

3. After the inital setup, the device will reboot, and you will need to connect to WiFi again after a reboot.

4. After the installation, you will need to connect to WiFi again.

# Arch Rock Configuration Utility (experimental)

We have created a configuration utility `arch-rock-config` just like [armbian-config](https://github.com/armbian/config), [rsetup](https://docs.radxa.com/en/radxa-os/rsetup/rsetup-tool), or [raspi-config](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/configuration.html) but for Arch Linux running on Rock 5 / RK3588.

Note: I am creating a new configuration utility called [acu](https://github.com/kwankiu/acu) which is based on this utility. This utility will be replaced by [acu](https://github.com/kwankiu/acu) once it is ready for use.

### Note that this configuration utility is work-in-progress.

  To launch the configuration utility:

```
arch-rock-config
```
